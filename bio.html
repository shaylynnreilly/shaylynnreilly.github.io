		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>My name is Shaylynn Reilly, and I'm an A&S computer science major at Tufts University, looking to graduate in the spring of 2016. I grew up in Westchester, NY. I only started programming last fall while taking the Intro to Computer Science course at Tufts, but immediately enjoyed it. I also have a passion for EMS, and am currently a member of Tufts Emergency Medical Services.</p>
